Car Rental System is based on a concept to rent cars and generate rental details of a rental company. Before stepping into the main system a user has to pass through a login system to get access. This mini project contains limited features, but the essential one.

Talking about the features of the Car Rental System, after logging in as a user he/she has to provide a name then the user can select available cars. Then the user has to provide the information such as Car number and number of days to rent the car.
